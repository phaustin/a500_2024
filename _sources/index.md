- **Catalog entry**: Atmospheric thermodynamics, cloud chemistry and
microphysics. Computer modeling of droplet growth, convection, and
mixing. Application of differential equations to atmospheric problems.

- **Description**: This course focuses on how to observe and understand
cloud processes, including mixing and convection, rain formation,
thunderstorms and cloud/climate interactions. It also introduces Python
programming and the use of numerical methods to solve simple
differential equations. If you need a computer lab account, see the main
office for a handout on how to pay the \$25 lab fee.

- **Pre or co-requisites**: Classical thermodynamics (PHYS 203 or CHEM 205)
and introductory ordinary differential equations (MATH 215). and
familiarity with a programming language.
