Course objectives
+++++++++++++++++

- ATSC 405 covers questions like:

  - What determines the vertical structure of the Earth's atmosphere?

  - How do clouds form?

  - How does precipitation form?

  - Why do thunderclouds become electrified?

  - What is the coupling between clouds and climate?

- and provides some practice with:

  - finding the equilibrium properties of a system
    
  - using conservation laws to describe the atmosphere

  - solving simple systems of ordinary differential equations

  - develop programming skills in matlab or python

- Course Learning objectives (General)

  1) use the laws of thermodynamics to predict atmospheric behavior
     at scales from milimeters to hundreds of kilometers

  2) formulate physical models of the processes by which atmospheric aerosols
     become clouds

  3) create themodynamic diagrams and use them to explain the growth and decay
     of clouds

  4) explain the process by which charge separates in convective clouds
    
  5) identify and explain changes in cloud properties caused by
     human activity

- Course Learning objectives (Computing)

  1) develop the habit of "casual computing" to quickly solve simple problems

  2) design, build and test reusable software components

  3) read and write common data formats containing observational and moddel
     output

  4) formulate and solve systems of differential equations using adaptive
     step solvers provided with Python or Matlab
