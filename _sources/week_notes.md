# Week notes

## Week 1

* Go over the [syllabus](index.md)

* Motivation -- [slides on boundary layer clouds and climate](https://phaustin.github.io/talks/cloud_talk.html)

### for Week 2

Read Chapter 1 of BLM.  For notation, especially virtual temperature, see the first 10 pages of Chapter 3 (thermodyanics) in Practical Meteorology

## Week 2

* Go over suppmental readings on Eulerian and Lagragian reference frames and frozen turbulence (Jardine lectures plus my Eulerian/Lagrangian notes)

* Introduce the dry les dataset and the week 3 notebook

### for week 3

* Read Stull chapter 3 and the Week 3 supplmentary notes
* Do the dry les notebook assignment -- soft deadline is Tuesday

## Week 3

* Thermodymamic review -- thermodynamic diagrams and scale height
* Buoyancy perturbations
* Solutions to the dry les notebook
* [Good tutorial on xarray](https://coecms-training.github.io/parallel/case-studies/loading_ensemble.html )
* How big are the pressure perturbation in the tropical_subset.nc notebook?

### For next week:

* Read [Dave Randalls scalling quickstudy](https://hogback.atmos.colostate.edu/group/dave/pdf/Dimensional_Analysis.pdf)
* Read Stull Chapter 4

## Week 4

* Go over 
  
  - notes on Taylor's series and Reynold's averaging
  - notes on the velocity scale
  - notes on virtual potential temperature
  
* For next Tuesday

  - Do Stull Chapter 4 problems 1, 3, 5
  - For the tropical subset dataset plot soundings of the potetial temperature flux, the temperature flux and the virtual potential temperature flux -- are they different
  - For the same notebook, plot the turbulent kinetic energy scaled by the convective velocity scale and the surface velocity scale -- are they different?
