# Week notes

## Week 1

* Go over the [syllabus](index.md)

* Motivation -- [slides on boundary layer clouds and climate](https://phaustin.github.io/talks/cloud_talk.html)

### for Week 2

Read Chapter 1 of BLM.  For notation, especially virtual temperature, see the first 10 pages of Chapter 3 (thermodyanics) in Practical Meteorology

## Week 2

* Go over suppmental readings on Eulerian and Lagragian reference frames and frozen turbulence (Jardine lectures plus my Eulerian/Lagrangian notes)

* Introduce the dry les dataset and the week 3 notebook

### for week 3

* Read Stull chapter 3 and the Week 3 supplmentary notes
* Do the dry les notebook assignment -- soft deadline is Tuesday

## Week 3

* Thermodymamic review -- thermodynamic diagrams and scale height
* Buoyancy perturbations
* Solutions to the dry les notebook
* [Good tutorial on xarray](https://coecms-training.github.io/parallel/case-studies/loading_ensemble.html )
* How big are the pressure perturbation in the tropical_subset.nc notebook?

### For next week:

* Read [Dave Randalls scalling quickstudy](https://hogback.atmos.colostate.edu/group/dave/pdf/Dimensional_Analysis.pdf)
* Read Stull Chapter 4

## Week 4

* Go over 
  
  - notes on Taylor's series and Reynold's averaging
  - notes on the velocity scale
  - notes on virtual potential temperature
  
* For next Tuesday

  - Do Stull Chapter 4 problems 1, 3, 5
  - For the tropical subset dataset plot soundings of the potetial temperature flux, the temperature flux and the virtual potential temperature flux -- are they different
  - For the same notebook, plot the turbulent kinetic energy scaled by the convective velocity scale and the surface velocity scale -- are they different?
  
*  Week 4 - Thursday

   - Focus on Stull sections 4.4.2 and 4.4.3 on moisture and heat fluxes
   - Look at sensible and latent fluxes in this notebook: {ref}`tropical_fluxes`
   - Go over my notes on [moist static energy](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/sosiyoxa9bzhecea5qas9/hydro.pdf?rlkey=7wll6s0yc4t0dlojzx56082iw&dl=0) 
   - Prep for the Clausius-Clayron equation: [notes on Maxwell's relations](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/o7d278acumkgmwe4y6qlu/clausius.pdf?rlkey=ktd5fvdwaz7ishuxozwmf6kwa&dl=0)
   - New example articles covering material from Chapter 7:  [Betts Horton Lecture](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/bams/85/11/bams-85-11-1673.xml) and [Betts Land Surface Coupling review](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3894/James.2009.1.4)

   - For next Tuesday:
   
     - Read Stull Chapter 5
     - Read my [static energy notes](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/sosiyoxa9bzhecea5qas9/hydro.pdf?rlkey=7wll6s0yc4t0dlojzx56082iw&dl=0) through page 6
     - Read my derivation of the [Clausius-Clapyron equation](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/o7d278acumkgmwe4y6qlu/clausius.pdf?rlkey=ktd5fvdwaz7ishuxozwmf6kwa&dl=0)
